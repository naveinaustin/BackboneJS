# BackboneJS
=========================
The repo consists of some examples that I have been working on with BackboneJS.

###### dynamicPanelSearch
=========================
Here I have created multiple views that are independant. These views can then be added to a panel to generate a UI. If the syntax is correctly followed then the panel will join the different views together to form a single panel.

###### singleLineAdvancedSearch
=========================
Here I created a single textbox which auto suggests what needs to be added. I have added three fields with two operators. These are then combined together using AND or OR. Once you finish the compoenent will return the statment entered.
